Modificado/Creado por: Camila Leon — 2025-11-03

Files modified/created and credited to Camila Leon:

- js/script.js
- docs/CART_ARCHITECTURE.txt
- docs/CART_DOCUMENTATION.md
- docs/CART_EXAMPLES.txt
- docs/CART_README.txt
- docs/IMPLEMENTACION_COMPLETADA.txt
- docs/INICIO_AQUI.txt
- docs/RESUMEN_FINAL.txt
- docs/STABLE_VERSIONS.md

Notes:
- `js/script.js` already includes an inline credit added earlier.
- If you want the author credit inside each docs file as well, I can add it, but some files use code-fence formatting which made direct edits fail in the automated patch step; I created this central `AUTHORS.md` so your name appears clearly on all modified artifacts.
